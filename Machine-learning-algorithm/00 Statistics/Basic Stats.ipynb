    "# 1. Introduction OF Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Statistics is the branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Before Going 1st we have to know types of Data\n",
    " \n",
    " - Actually There Are Mainly Two types of data\n",
    "    1. Numerical\n",
    "    2. Categorical \n",
    "    \n",
    "### 1. In Numerical it divided further two types :\n",
    "\n",
    "          a. Discrete (Use in classification)  \n",
    "          b. Continuous (Use In Regression)\n",
    "    \n",
    " a. Discrete Data Type:\n",
    " - The Value Which Counted As Whole or fixed value.\n",
    " \n",
    " ex. 1,45,73 but not 23.42,36.54\n",
    " \n",
    " - integer value is discrete value.\n",
    " \n",
    " ex. age,no. of vechile\n",
    " \n",
    " b. Continous Data Type:\n",
    " - Here Value Contain Range,Measurement \n",
    " \n",
    " eg. 1.3,1.5,1.6 but not 1,5,6\n",
    " \n",
    " - it is floating type value\n",
    " \n",
    " Eg. weight in kg, House price\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2. Categorical  Also Divided Two types :\n",
    "\n",
    "          a. Ordinal      \n",
    "          b. Nominal\n",
    "          \n",
    " a. Ordinal :\n",
    " - These are meaningfully ordered\n",
    " \n",
    " Eg.Rating Of Product, Grade Of Mark\n",
    " \n",
    " - Here the Quality Increase Lower to Higher and Higher to Lower in order.\n",
    " \n",
    " b. Nominal :\n",
    " - Here No Intrinsic order of the label\n",
    " \n",
    " - all label are not in order.\n",
    " \n",
    " Eg. Color - as in color there are many color like Red,green,black etc but can you find any order between them , Ans is no so these type are nominal .\n",
    " \n",
    "- Basically Categorical are in String (Object) Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- Numerical are Float or int Format in dataset."
